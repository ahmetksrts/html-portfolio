<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have an interest in software ever since I know myself. I always dreamed to be 
  professional in software. I am currently a double major student in Yeditepe 
  University. I am trying to learn as much as I can to improve myself in software. I 
  also want to learn upper-level game development to develop games. I also have 
  interest about software part of electronics such as FPGA's and embedded 
  systems.</p>
